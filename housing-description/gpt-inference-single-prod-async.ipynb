    "Extract the numerical amount of units (dwelling units, apartments, condos, hotel, housing units, residential units, etc.) proposed to be **added** from the project description. Follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Explicit Mentions of Units:**  \n",
    "   - If a number is associated with housing terms (e.g., \"3 dwelling units,\" \"73 residential condos,\" \"2-unit apartment building\"), extract that number.\n",
    "2. **Handle Modifications Carefully:**  \n",
    "   - If a project changes a previously approved number of units (e.g., reducing 12 units to 10), use the **originally proposed total units, not the new total.**  \n",
    "   - If unclear, return **-1**.\n",
    "3. **Ignore Non-Housing Numbers:**  \n",
    "   - Do not extract parking spaces, floor counts, lot numbers, or building square footage as unit counts.  \n",
    "   - Example: \"54 parking spaces for a 27-unit condo\" → Output: **27** (not 54).\n",
    "4. **Account for Partial Retentions and Additions:**  \n",
    "   - If a project **keeps some units and adds new ones,** return the **total number of units post-development**.  \n",
    "   - Example: \"Retaining 3 existing units and adding 5\" → Output: **8**.\n",
    "5. **Single-Family Homes and ADUs:**  \n",
    "   - SFH/SFD (Single Family Home/Dwelling) = **1 unit**.  \n",
    "   - ADUs (Accessory Dwelling Units) **must** be counted as additional units unless explicitly stated otherwise.  \n",
    "   - Example: \"New detached 707 SQ FT ADU\" → Output: **1**. \n",
    "6. **If housing units are being proposed but No Explicit Number Is Mentioned, Return -1.**  \n",
    "   - Example: \"Rezoning for future housing development\" → Output: **-1**.\n",
    "7. If the project is entirely **non-residential** (e.g., commercial, retail, restaurants, bars) and no residential units are mentioned, return 0.\n",
    "   - Example: \"New shopping center with retail and restaurant spaces\" → Output: 0.\n",
    "   - Example: \"Master Conditional Use Permit for on- and off-site alcohol sales\" → Output: 0.\n",
    "   - Be cautious not to overclassify as 0 — if the description is unclear but mentions housing in any form, default to -1 instead of 0.\n",
    "8. **Avoid Arbitrary Defaults:**  \n",
    "   - Do not assign numbers unless explicitly stated in the text.\n",
