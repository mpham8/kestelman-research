       "\" Moving right on to public comment we do have one speaker Mr. Herman can I invite you up please? Could we put two minutes on the clock please? Are we on commissioners? Welcome. Please introduce yourself. For the record, my name is Armando Herman. I'm a resident constituent here in Boyle Heights. In the last five years or so, we've been working so hard to make a good measure of balance when it comes to what municipal colds are and what city ordinance are for. Obviously the city has refused to, and I use the word refused because for five years if you cannot come up with an agreement of an ordinance that protects the rights of not just artists, protects the rights of liberals who like art. I'm going to, you have to focus not on one of the items that's on the agenda, I'm sorry. I'm bringing my motion in. Don't violate my brown act here. So to say and continue. The point of discussion is this, why has this commission waited so long to enforce an ordinance or being a place? Okay, I'm going to have to interrupt you. I made it really clear in the beginning we can't talk about an item that's on the agenda. You'll have an opportunity to speak when the mural ordinance is there. I'm speaking on an agenda item. I'm not going into the points of that discussion, sir, or sirs. Michael, do you want a pine on this? It might within grounds of the Brown Act or my inviolation of discrimination. There's 40 seconds on the clock. Okay go ahead. So to conclude all I ask is that whatever situation that this commission has and takes responsibly for, be accountable for the citizens of Los Angeles. They want decisions made now in a timely matter, not postponed without transparency. Because I've been in this council chambers more than once in discussion about items that have not been put into motion. Mr. Herman, thank you for being here. Let's see. One other item we have to cover. Minutes of the meeting. Do I have a motion to approve the minutes? From our last meeting, please. Motion to approve the minutes. Do I have a second? I have a second. Thank you, James. Would you hold the commission? Certainly. Commissioner Freer? Yes. Commissioner Hobbogumi? Yes. Commissioner Burton? All right. Commissioner Cardoso? Yes. Commissioner Kim? Yes. Commissioner Wu? Yes. Commissioner Rochen? Yes. Motion carries. Thank you all and for our first item. Let me introduce item 4.\""
