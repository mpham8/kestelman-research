    "\t•\t“This will add jobs, but it also displaces residents.” → Likely neutral (2)\n",
    "\t•\tUnrelated or Procedural Comments: If a comment discusses general meeting logistics, requests for clarification, or unrelated concerns, classify as neutral (2).\n",

Point City of Place, this is just south of Sunset Boulevard and east of La Brea. It's a vacant site and it's 39 total units, 36 market rate and three affordable units. They were eligible for two incentives, a 20% decrease in the required front yard, allowing a depth of 12 feet and a 20% increase in the allowable FAR from 3 to 1 to 3.6 to 1, and it includes 78 parking spaces and complies with all other municipal code sections.  So state density bonus law states that when an applicant seeks a density bonus, the city is required to grant it unless the appellant can prove that either the incentives are not necessary for inclusion of the affordable units or that there's a detrimental impact on physical safety and the environment.  owner of the building directly.  to the south of the site and the appeal points had to do with environmental uses and conditions that were mitigated in the mitigated negative declaration. So the appeal points had to do with noise and dust during construction and then a couple of process issues.  This is the site. It just shows that it's a vacant site and it's surrounded by  other multifamily residential uses.  This shows that the residential area, it's R3 zoning, and then it's commercial, just a long-sense at Boulevard to the north of the site.  These are some pictures of the site. This is the actual vacant site with the building to the west of it.  This is the adjacent property on the north side by sunset boulevard. And this is the south, the property of the south, which is the appellance property.  This is across the street from the subject property just a typical multi-family building in the area.  And then we have some drawings that we included earlier today in your packet. And I'm good. I was going to have Nicole Sanchez, the staff planner come up and just walk you through. The findings are made based on design guidelines in the Hollywood community plan. And that's what the director's determination did was was look for facade articulation.

It's huge and the thing that only 25% of the women are allocated for low income housing which making Hiccus isn't even going to get a priority in.

      "getting prediction for:  you  Thank you.  Thank you very much President Morocco for the record. Steve San, I'm speaking here as an individual. I am the chairman of the Westwood Community Council, but I want to be very clear I'm speaking as an individual. This case did not come before our council. I'm a huge fan of SDK. I'm a customer of SDK. I've dined there. I love the place.  I support their entertainment, I support their DJ, I actually suggested they get a dance permit because sometimes people do get up and dance and didn't want them to get a ticket because that actually happened at Whiskey Blue at the W but they decided not to do that and that is of course their choice.  I live on Tiverton Avenue. I'm the only person who's testified who actually lives behind this building.  and  I walk the community, I'm in the community all the time.  what I have not heard at all today.  is what's before you legally.  and that is where is the error or abuse of discretion? To grant this appeal, you must find that Mr. Chu committed an error or abused his discretion when he reasonably relied on the recommendations, the expertise and the input of the police. I've not heard a word of that. And you did get some letters, many of them actually, documenting very serious concerns. And finally, the fact that this building for 19 years has been zoned and permitted only to midnight. Why is that? Because it's not BJs, it's not Barney's. It backs up to a residential street. Thank you very much, Mrs. Smith.\n",

I mean, as I said here since 8 o'clock in the morning and observed, you know, other people go through. I mean, we're against it.  Our tenants are against it. We have elderly tenants on the property. We have people that work night shifts on the property.  I mean, it's a huge impact.  But  One of the most important things is blatant refusal of the developer to meet with us and discuss anything. I mean, once we received the only notice that we have received was 90-day excavation notice. And the notice stated that within 90 days the excavation is going to start at zero feet from the property line. Zero feet.  There was no proposed structural engineering report, structural survey of our property. How it's going to be affected? How the shoreings is going to be done? Are they going to use tiebacks, going underground into our property? I mean, we send an email asking the developer for a meeting to meet with us. There was no response.  So other than filing a lawsuit to protect our interests in this property, I just don't know what else to do.  Thank you.\n",

I want to thank the commission for allowing me to speak on this item.  I'm here in support of SDKs appeal.  on the restrictions at the proposed side, 1100 South Glendon, in order to help support the business community in Westwood Village.  Over the last year since the planning commission supported the Westwood communities efforts to amend the Westwood Village specific plan ordinance, we've seen over 10 businesses open.  and more showing interest every day.  The neighborhood is gaining significant momentum. It's a comeback to the business community like Westwood hasn't seen in 40 years.  and if an operator with a quality reputation,  such as SDK can open in a space that's been vacant for several year student restrictions that don't exist at their Hill Guard location.  It'll create a chilling effect.  to the momentum that this community has worked so hard to build.  If you talk to any of the businesses in Westwood, they all say they want to see a healthier nighttime economy. Please support SDK's effort to appeal the restrictions.\n",
