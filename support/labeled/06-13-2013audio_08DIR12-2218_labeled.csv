2," Thank you James, me, congratulations. Thank you for the nice project.  commissioners we have one last case. I think Debbie we're going to go to lunch now and  Thank you.",
8, you,
2, That was a bad joke. We should go out to lunch. Let's go out to lunch.,
8, you  We should go out.  you,
2," We've been waiting all day to hear from you, Debbie.  commissioners can we all hang in there?  up here.",
4," Good afternoon commissioners Debbie Lawrence, Department of City Planning. This is an appeal of a density bonus compliance review case and these are director determinations and these are but the appeals go to city planning commission.",
2," And again, I think the report is pretty clear. So if you can do it as succinctly as you can.",
4, can do.  Thank you.,
2," And do we have an applicant here?  and do we have the appellant?  Are you the appellant?  Okay, so you're both here.  Great.  I don't have speaker cards.  Did you? Thank you.  Are you Aaron? I've got yours.",
4," So staff recommends denying the appeal and the project description.  It's for 39 residential units in the Hollywood community plan area. Point City of Place, this is just south of Sunset Boulevard and east of La Brea. It's a vacant site and it's 39 total units, 36 market rate and three affordable units. They were eligible for two incentives, a 20% decrease in the required front yard, allowing a depth of 12 feet and a 20% increase in the allowable FAR from 3 to 1 to 3.6 to 1, and it includes 78 parking spaces and complies with all other municipal code sections.  So state density bonus law states that when an applicant seeks a density bonus, the city is required to grant it unless the appellant can prove that either the incentives are not necessary for inclusion of the affordable units or that there's a detrimental impact on physical safety and the environment.  owner of the building directly.  to the south of the site and the appeal points had to do with environmental uses and conditions that were mitigated in the mitigated negative declaration. So the appeal points had to do with noise and dust during construction and then a couple of process issues.  This is the site. It just shows that it's a vacant site and it's surrounded by  other multifamily residential uses.  This shows that the residential area, it's R3 zoning, and then it's commercial, just a long-sense at Boulevard to the north of the site.  These are some pictures of the site. This is the actual vacant site with the building to the west of it.  This is the adjacent property on the north side by sunset boulevard. And this is the south, the property of the south, which is the appellance property.  This is across the street from the subject property just a typical multi-family building in the area.  And then we have some drawings that we included earlier today in your packet. And I'm good. I was going to have Nicole Sanchez, the staff planner come up and just walk you through. The findings are made based on design guidelines in the Hollywood community plan. And that's what the director's determination did was was look for facade articulation. But this just shows you I'll just have her walk you through the plans.",1
7," after a new commissioners, Nicole Sanchez with the Pioneer Department. So the slide that you see here is the front elevation of the building facing east onto Punxeria Place.  As previously mentioned, this project is a density bonus project, therefore it complies with section 12.22, 825 of the LEMC.  which requires any density bonus project with on menu incentives to comply with certain design features.  This project also incorporates some of the Hollywood Community Plan Design Guidelines, as well as the Planning Department's City of White Residential Design Guidelines.  Some of those guidelines include articulation on the facade that are but a street with a change in material, textures or a break and plane.",1
2," So I'm going to interrupt if that's okay. I think this is again pretty clear. And this has already been approved. The project has, you know, and now it's back here just for the appellant. So unless you have some summation remarks, I'd like to go right to the",
7, Thank you.  a few points maybe?,
2," Yes, please. That would be perfect.",
7," Okay.  So here is a summary of the appeal points that we received.  They're primarily related to the short-term construction impacts.  which have all been mitigated either through the M&D or conditioned in the director's determination.  So once again, we recommend denial of the appeal and sustaining the director's donation, approving, identity bonus compliance review. Great.",1
2," Thank you very much. Commissioners, if everybody's comfortable, I'd like to go right to the appellate. And here from him first.  if I put five minutes on the clock, would that be enough?  you",
3, went to  you  Let's go to four. Good afternoon commissioners. My name is Aaron Kugliak and I'm the owner of the 1435-37-Pinsides Head Place. The site is directly adjacent to the proposed construction site. We're basically here to object to the whole project since there was no notices that were ever.  sent to us other than 90 days excavation notice we own this property for seven years there are three partners,-1
2," and you're immediately adjacent, right? I'm sorry? You're property.",
3, directly adjacent about 120 feet of common line.,
2, and no notice is one of the points.,
3," No notices that we are aware of were given to either me or two of my other partners.  And we basically would like an opportunity to go through the same process. I mean, as I said here since 8 o'clock in the morning and observed, you know, other people go through. I mean, we're against it.  Our tenants are against it. We have elderly tenants on the property. We have people that work night shifts on the property.  I mean, it's a huge impact.  But  One of the most important things is blatant refusal of the developer to meet with us and discuss anything. I mean, once we received the only notice that we have received was 90-day excavation notice. And the notice stated that within 90 days the excavation is going to start at zero feet from the property line. Zero feet.  There was no proposed structural engineering report, structural survey of our property. How it's going to be affected? How the shoreings is going to be done? Are they going to use tiebacks, going underground into our property? I mean, we send an email asking the developer for a meeting to meet with us. There was no response.  So other than filing a lawsuit to protect our interests in this property, I just don't know what else to do.  Thank you.",-1
2," Aaron, thank you for being here.  Can I invite up the applicant and would you address those appeal points for us?",
6," First of all, my name is Don Tolentino and I'm here for Isaac Coansett for San Jose San Jose  I think that Banner's my most is the invention that we  we refuse to be...  to being communication with them.  Actually, you talk to me and don't tell anyone before first.",
2," So what did you, yeah, what did you talk to us? Talk to us and just do your best to describe what you understand.",
6, So what are you?  I'm sorry.  but you understand. So I received that call and immediately gave it to the owners and I believe they responded to them.  and I asked specifically to send an email to the owner.  and  I don't know what happened then from then.,
2," So there's the notice issue and how about the structural soils reports, all of that.",
6," the night shift.  about the noteworthy. Which not, sir?  He said that he's not been notified. When we fight the case, we have our religious, the abatting owners, mailing notices and everything. So I believe he was notified. Maybe he didn't get it from the mail. So I think we cannot be blamed for that, sir.",
2," Here is, let's, you know, I can't speak out of turn. In plus, it's not recorded unless you're talking into a microphone, so thank you. Anything else you want to add? I'm going to invite staff back up. I'm just here to have the questions. Okay, thank you. Thanks for being here, both of you. Can I invite staff back up?",
6, I can't speak out of it.  Thanks for coming.  Okay.,
2," Can you put your appeal points back on the screen?  So the access, can you guys speak to that at all?  And also if you would speak, this is a very different process than the previous project we saw in terms of both public engagement and participation. Maybe you could explain that to us why this process is different.",
4," So it was a director's determination, so there was no public hearing, but the determination went out to both the appellant and the property.  or the property owner and the applicant.  And then when it was appealed by the adjacent property owner, we also sent another.  another determination and both of them received that as well. Now the addresses that we use are what we have on our record.  And possibly there was an issue with that, but I mean, I can state the two addresses if you would like me to. But if you want me just to cover the appeal points. So the appeal points in the letter.",
10," I'm going to address one at a time if we could. So as far as the notice, so after the director's made a determination, then notice was sent by mail. Yes. And did that notice give them some information as to how they could respond if they had concerns? Was there a telephone number provided in address? Yes. OK.",
2, data.,
4," Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  you  Yeah, it's provided. It was a determination letter. So it went in and it states on that it's a 15 day appeal period on the original determination.",
10," And do you have a record of what addresses that notice was sensitive? Yes. And is that the same address that the appellant used for his appeal? I don't see the appeal here. I'm trying to find the actual appeal table work. But is that the same address, do we know?",
4, Yes.,
1, you,
4," very  Yes, it is. It's 11601 Santa Monica Boulevard.  And that's the label that it went to.",
10, Okay.,
4," you  you  And then the other one is 1-1-3-1-5, Dona Lola Drive, which is the appellance address that it was sent to, which is not the address of the actual property.",
10, Thank you.  And it's the same address that the excavation notice I assume was sent to.  that the balance was the first key to learn to bit.,
4," Yeah.  Right, the Studio City address, it's the Dona Lola drive address that we send it to, that we send our determination to.",
10, Okay.,
4," And I think it's the same, I mean we have the same system so building and safety would use the same address. It's the assessor and the city clerk address that we have in our system.",
10, Do you have a copy of the notice? Any chance that we take a look at?,
4, Yes.  We included in your packet.  We've also got the original one.  but here's the actual notice.,
10," I'd love a chance to look at that. And the other point that I want to focus on, at least for me, the purposes is, while I can understand a neighbor having concerns when a large construction project is going to be next to them, it seems to me in reading the report that they had a matter of right they could build 29 units. So we're only dealing with the density bonus, the difference between the construction of 29 and 39. I think we need to be mindful of that when we look at",
4," So the appeal points, we responded since the appeal points had to do with impacts related to construction, such as noise and dust. And there were some points there that had to do with the process that we were just talking about. We, since an emitting a neck deck was prepared for it, the mitigation measures addressed all of the appeal points. And that was how we responded and recommended, it made our recommendation to deny the appeal.",1
2, And that's an explanation you could offer to the appellant so that he does understand that there are conditions that you do address.,
4," right.  and the conditions were listed in the determination letter. All of the, like with other determinations, we have administrative conditions, but all of the conditions for the environmental were listed in that determination letter.",
2, on it.  the structural integrity of the property. Could you explain to us how that's handled?,
4," What's that was? How that's handled.  There was an appeal point in the letter that just said, soils and engineering report, or it just referenced the report, a structural engineering report.",
2, So as soils engineering report would be they were worried about the structure.,
4," They were worried about the structural, and there was a report. Right.",
2, ensuring design will be,
4, We required to.,
2, required for this project.,
8," this question. Mr. Murnister, a record in conditions 11 and 12, feel specifically with that. And again, in the",
4, mission.  Thank you.  you,
8, I'm a doctor.,
4, you,
8, you,
4," you  Yeah, the conditions. And they were repeated in the appeal letter as well.  So air pollution, demolition, grading, and construction activities were addressed, you know, such as  transported off site and wetting the dust, the standard mitigation measures for construction dirt.  There was also...  The ones having to do with noise and there was a minimum five foot and two foot landscape buffer to be put in against all walls.",1
2," And I guess I would add this is not unusual, this process, and that I can see in any way. So maybe staff would take the time to walk the appellant through and explain to them that this is a very common situation and the city's, I think, very competent and dealing with these points. I'm ready for a motion unless we need further discussion.",
0, explained.,
2, Dana?,
10, I still so do you have the actual notice that was originally sent out though that's what I was hoping to see,
4, It was a director's determination so there was no notice of a public hearing because it was not a public hearing. But we did send out was a determination letter which showed the director's determination.,
10, But that went to the neighbor.,
4, Exhibit me in your package and I believe it's the one that I,
10, I don't see that address to the neighbor.,
5, change Williamson.  Good.,
0," Sean Abon since the planning department we don't address the neighbor in the letter. Our records show in the file who we mailed it to and we received no letters or envelopes that were returned saying that it was not sent. Okay, that's I just want to ask for this.",
4, Okay.,
10," Okay, I just want to say that.",
4," So the property owner is the neighbor. That's the one that says point, Sedia. The one, Wiseman development.",
10," Thank you.  Well, that's the same address as the applicant and the representative. All I need to know is this document exhibit being our package is the document that was sent correct.",
4," Right, that's the original and of course the appellant wouldn't be on on that one, but on the appeal notice the appellant is is listed there along with the with the property owner. So there were two the first one would not include.",
10, right.,
4," Um  The appellant accept that determinations are sent to abutting property owners.  So the appellant did include, did get that notice. It's just not showing on your determination, but they're included as an inviting property owner.",
2, Final comments from Dana more something else final comments Regina did you want to say?,
4, on the screen.,
1," I just think that something that this illuminates is that we have seen this regularly and obviously the department sees this regularly But a joining property owner is probably going to see this once in their property owning lifetime And so for us to just be as sensitive as possible to explaining the process for them What is you know legally required how those legal requirements are met that we you know offer some patients on our part and obviously on the staff which I'm sure you do to help neighboring property owners understand what their rights are when their rights can be evoked at what point in the process and that we do that with some  So we don't, I mean, we throw around acronyms. We do a lot of things because we get used to doing it. And I just think that it's important for us to be sensitive to that. For our problem. So to take the time to do that with the joining property owner, I think, would be appreciated for everybody. Thank you.",
0, you,
4, I promise.  because the first time they would hear of it would be when they would receive the determination. And so for many people that can be quite...,
1," Exactly. And for a density bonus case, there are ways that it takes it to a different level in terms of notice and what becomes a director's determination.",
4, you  for a density of,
2," and I would appreciate that as well to give, you know, the appellant as much confidence in the process as we can.  Sean.",
8," With that in mind, I'm prepared to make a motion that we denide the appeal and sustain the director's determination.",
2, Do I have a second?  you,
0, second.,

5," Certainly, Commissioner Burton. Aye. Commissioner Aing.  you",
