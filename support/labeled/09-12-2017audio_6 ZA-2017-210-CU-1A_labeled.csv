8," Item number 6. Item number 6 is case number Z82017210CU1A. Project site is 5815-5825 west sunset boulevard. The project is in Council District 13. Appeal of the zoning administrators' determination to approve a conditional use permit to allow a transient occupancy residential structure in an appeal of the categorical exemption. At this time, we will hear from staff and also would like to state that this is a continuance from the state of the state.  are August 8th, 2017.  hearing where we had our public testimony at that time.",
2," Good evening, Commission President and Commissioner. This is Jack John, this is on Administrator who I oversee this case.  items submitted to you or are conditions submitted by the applicant and revised condition number 11, 12, 13 and 15. It should be part of the packet. So the applicant, the property owner has a men 3 conditions in regards to its business model.  and also a young sign manager. I have revised Conditioning 11, 12.  13 and 15 just for more clarity.  Okay.",
0," I'm sorry. Just for the record, I believe Commissioner Delgado needed to make a statement because he wasn't here on the September of August 8 meeting.",
7," Commissioner Dogado, I've reviewed the audio files and the minutes for the last meeting of August 8th and I'm caught up to speed.",
2," Okay, thank you, Commissioner.  So these are the items I request by the commission last time to amend, okay additional item that I submitted to you is  Similar type of cases that will approve because that was a question asked by the commissioner and also I believe that Helen also have a similar that same same question so I Ask our ZAs in the department if they have done any Trans-Analcuban Z-Rest-Entre-Structure projects in the past few years Only Maya Zazefsky replying and she has done one that she approved back in 2013. The project was it's a locating of Venice planning area and it's a conversion.  from the residential apartment into the tours, the transient occupancy, residential structure. It's not exactly the same as the project before you because the project before you maintains both apartment and the tours use, but this one is a complete  conversion. Okay.  I also mentioned that there is a project located on Woj≈°er, right, right around the MacArthur Park area. I call the applicant and that project never penciled out so it did not become an application. However, what I want to present to you is a joint memo issued by a joint department memo issued by the Planning Department and also  Building safety on February 27th, 2014. Now, this memo basically stays that general plan visioned this route and new  Regional center and district will be the most densely developed.  in Los Angeles and characterised by lively mixed residential commercial and detainment retail and visitors serving uses to help realise this vision. The exception, okay, this memo is to relax the citywide regulation government permitted uses of land and yard requirement for the buildings. Now this memo is stipulated at a hotel, a apartment hotel in CRC1C.5C2C4 and C5 zones. Basically covers all the commercial area. In the central city community plan area or area designated by the community plan as regional center or regional commercial. Okay.  to be exempted with conditional use. Okay, so even a hotel, a part of a hotel is located within 500 feet of an arson. So if you have a project that's located,  Ian  This is a red hatch area. That's a regional center commercial. So this covers the entire downtown. And areas are a long washer boulevard from downtown all the way to Korea town, Western Avenue.  and also  majority area of Hollywood, okay, community, the hatch area.  Project like this, okay, but conforming.  to the criteria if it's a new construction or adapt to reuse, okay, or conversion existing buildings to allow  Um  that has a historical significance, you don't need the conditional use. So my point is that there could be a lot of this project that all they need is just go to building and safety, who a building permit without coming to planning department for a conditional use. Okay. So this project that before you, I don't think qualifies for this.  this memo, but I want to illustrate the fact that there must be a lot of a tourist project.  in the cities of system, that's not before us. And in order to find out, that has to be a search through building premise system.  Okay.  So.  that's all I want to say in regards to the possible distype of cases that occurs in the city. Now for the Mitchell-Politan law,  My feeling is that this is a unique area. It's a unique use. In other area, I will not consider a proof of it, but this project basically serves a creative office use. That's why it's very different. Okay, and I think it's important to maintain the apartment use on site as well. Because this is not a typical hotel use. Now you're got to hear, I think you probably see a couple letters from the Hollywood Chambers and the other one from the NABU Council.  Thank you and for your late neighborhood council.  Thank you.  They talk about the hotel use.  To me, I think this is a very different from the hotel use because this allows, this course, especially for this project, allows longer stay. This is not geared towards a visitor for a couple of days.  These people may stay on site for two weeks, three weeks, maybe two months. Okay?  I think the use is very important to cover both on the 30 days and over 30 days. Because if you do not allow the apartment use, then the tenants outside, when it crossed the 30 days, then basically,  city city does not enforce any sort of a tendency of inside a hotel over 30 days, but city does  enforce the housing actions and housing regulation on apartments that's if it's for short-term rentals. So if it tenants,  stay if you don't maintain a hotel. I mean the apartment use in the tenant stays over 30 days then Nobody's overseeing nobody's overseeing the tenant rights as an apartment do all are okay But I think it's also very important to to approve this project because there is an absolute it absolute need in this area to to provide Sort of a and transient occupancy residence structure for  in  a sort of a longer, longer-term short-term stays. Okay? This is not a hotel use. Okay? So, even though people are trying to sell you that, the area needs a hotel or there may be other hotel projects coming in, but this is not exactly a hotel use. Okay? So, I think that basically concludes my comments for this project.",1
8," Commissioner Chunkham, so I need one clarification regarding  I guess other cases similar to this. So just to be clear, there are no precedents in place for mixed use in the sense of transient and long term.  Correct.",
2, I have.,
8, Thank you.,
2, That's right. I did not find other ones.,
5, I didn't know.,
8, now.,
2, Okay.,
5," And that.  Sorry, this is strange, but that's only the ones that require conditional use. I think what  Jack.  I was pointing out was that...  If you're in the regional center area, you can go to building and safety and add tours.",
8, Thank you.,
5," to your building, your certificate of occupancy, so you could have both.",
8, you.,
5, tours and just regular dwelling units. It's just that we would have to go through a search of building permits.,
0, mm-hmm.,
5, and to be able to identify how many of those exist throughout the city.,
8," Mr. Chunkan, because...  I'm going to have to ask you to walk through the modified or your  your proposed modifications to the conditions. However, prior to that, I know that two of the commissioners that were at the last hearing regarding this case, who aren't here, I know that some of the biggest concerns during that meeting was pertaining to how to obtain that number of dedication for permanent  or more long-term use versus the transient occupants. And we were having trouble coming up with that type of number.",
2, you  Thank you.  you  I have to refer to the applicant because I think right now they are still maintaining the 52 units as both apartment units and transient occupancy risk and structure units. We can call the applicant up and have them have him to explain that.,
8," Okay, prior to that, can you walk us through this a little bit? I'm not sure if you guys have further questions.",
2, Thank you.  you,
7," Okay.  I do commission to the Ghatau.  I think in addition to how to divvy up the percentage of those units and how to, and their designation, it was also how to distribute them throughout the floors. And I think there was a question versus whether top floor metaphor, metaphor. I do have some questions or some updates that I'd like to get. And I don't know who would have that information. And I read an information regarding, and it came up several times regarding two, four specific, very low income units and whether or not those are regarding four specific very low income units and whether or not those are in fact designated as low income units.",
0, Correct.  We're not full.  some of the things that I'm going to do.,
2," Okay, those four...  This project, Metropolitan Law, it's part of the larger project to the west of the metropolitan creative campus. That created campus, it encompassed the metropolitan tower and the metropolitan creative office. To the west, there's a metropolitan west apartment, I think it's 76 apartment units. That four units that you were talking about, four of our units, that's in that apartment. It's not within the metropolitan law building. Okay.",
7," Great. Sorry, the next question. Yes. Is there an update on the one tenant that was at this unit that was nearing the lease? Nearing the 12 month lease?",
2," Yes.  I think that the tendency will end in September, but we can ask the applicant to clarify. Okay. Now, going back to Commissioner President Chunking's question, I think now",
0, you,
7, Great.,
0, you,
2," The property owner has a submit.  the first three condition, I think the first condition, illustrate their plans for the business model. So they are going to move the existing tenant to the upper floor. So have the lower floor open up for the short-term rentals. So that's the existing plans. But as far as how many units were permanently assigned to apartments and how many units were permanently assigned to the tours, I don't think that we have that information available. So I still maintain that the applicant, it's the property owner still want to do all 52 units as an apartment, both apartments and tours use. How are they going to rent those, the units rent out as the short term I think it's still based on the market demand.  Okay.",
8," Commissioner Trump came and so forward the  conditions 11.  12, 13, 15. Can you just walk us through? I know there were questions regarding the language specifically and so if you can walk us through those changes.",
2," Okay. No. Condition 11. I believe Commissioner Chimorinsky was saying that there has to be some sort of  So, I just added that the applicant  shall not display or be evictive without just cause. So that if the tenant breach the lease agreement as to become nuisance or become the, becomes, or endangered properties or not pay rent, then they can be evicted. But that's why I just add the phrase without just cause as to breach lease agreement. So the lease agreement itself will have terms. So I'm just keeping the language sort of a flexible. Now condition number two, there was a question in regards to the 30 days and 60 days. Now which type of tenants should be served with 30 days or which type of tenants should be served with 60 days. Then I checked the California Department's consumer affairs. It has regulation in regards to the noticing. Now if you  It doesn't, the notice was served to tenet. It, that doesn't matter what type of lease agreement you have. Whether it's months to months or it's a yearly lease, it does not matter. But what matter is how long have you stay on the property? So if you stay on the property for less than one year, then 30 days notice applies. If you, if you have to live on the property for more than a year, 12 months, then 60 days leads will apply. I mean, 60 days notice will apply. So I basically, I change the language. I'd be more clear that the applicant shall comply to the California Department of Consumer Affair and Noticing Requirement, okay?  allow the tenants to stay up additional 30 days, okay, beyond the terms of tenancy, okay, in case they are  relocating. Alright, so this is just an additional month or additional month that they can have.  All right.",
3," I have a question. So to clarify, if they have an existing lease, this says that they can't be terminated without just cause. But once that lease is over, then they can terminate the lease. But these are the.",
2, Bye.,
3, the amount of time that they would be required to give.,
2," Correct, that's right.",
3, Notice. OK.,
2," All right. So condition 13, it has to do with the security. The regional grant already had a security condition, all right. But I think one question was asked whether they will be security patrol. So the property owner agreed that they can off, they can provide security, guard service. Okay, so on site, 24 hours a day. All right, so I add that. The last condition is number 15, that on site manager, I just say that available for 24 hours a day. Now that is already a part of the determination.  Now this is...  The on-site manager is required by the state law for any apartment that's more than 16 units. You have to have a 24 hour on-site manager. This is basically a regulatory compliance measure. I mean, I don't think that it's necessary, but I think having that language basically will, you know, will be more clear to you the property owner.",
8," Thank you.  You can just give me a moment to read through some of the other language.  Commissioner Tom Kim. So I think in terms of just addressing some of the concerns and questions from the last meeting, these proposed modifications to the conditions suffice. How do you guys feel?",
7," Commissioner Doga, I would agree based on the concerns that I have that were addressed earlier and the revised conditions I would be inclined to make a decision.",
8," Commissioner Chunkham, so the only really pending or an answered part of our last discussion would be  Just how do you...  divide up that property and so I'm inclined to bring the applicant back up because I believe staff said that would be a question for the applicant.",
3," Commissioner Mendes, we had also asked for feedback from the council office. Did we get any input from them on this?",
2, Now.  you  That's not... I have no comments in regards to this project.,
8," Okay, so at this time, can we bring it?  the applicant.  Stir new men back up.  So if you can just a dress, you'll have five minutes.",
1, I just need to answer you one question I think is you've asked a question I wanted I would like to answer that Stay tuned,
4, Thank you.,
1," My name is Jerry Newman. Thank you, President Chunkham, members of the commission. The question that was asked and that was asked of us, relative to last hearing, is how do you divvy up the apartments and tours? And I think",
4, you,
1," Mr. Chang made an adequate description of what we thought about. We started thinking through a business plan and I think Commissioner Delgado kind of hit the nail on the head in some ways of saying, well, you know, what's fair? How do you divide things up? What floors do you put them on in the like?  And the way we started thinking about it from a business model perspective was for those people who have been there and were not subjected to a transient occupancy near them, it is unfair or potentially unfair to expose them to it without having a consolidated floor that is dedicated to them.  tenants left that we would move to two consolidated floors.  thereafter and those floors would remain such until such time as those tenants have either left or tenancy or not.  Then people who come in terms of the marketplace, we would provide, you'll see that in our business plan, there's a series of notices that are required. And the notices were meant to inform both individuals who want to rent on a long-term basis that this is an effect of a mixed apartment building and that there may be people who are a temporary occupant near them. And if so, these are their rights. And these are the ways that they can have complaints and these is how we will take care of them. And that way, they can make the decision on whether to rent the apartment or not. And if they're renting it, they're renting it with knowledge that they could be living next to someone who is a temporary occupant. On the flip side of that, we wanted to also notify the temporary occupants that they are living in a building that could have permanent residents and as such there is a code of conduct relative to that and given that there are temporary which would mean that they're less than 30 days there's a we've imposed a three strike rule if there's three complaints against the temporary resident they're out with without question you know and it would be three strikes within that 30 day period. That way ensuring that we are both serving the community that we are not going to be able to do that. We are not going to be able to do that without question, you know, and it would be three strikes within that 30-day period. That way ensuring that we are both serving the community that we want and providing the most flexibility for the building because the reality is as Mr. Chang identified, this is a very special part of Hollywood and we believe it serves a population of the studios in the entertainment industry and trying to be fair to the residents that exist there, giving them a longer term, allowing them to be on a separate floor during their whole tenancy and thereafter making sure that everyone is aware of the rules of the game. And that seemed like the wisest business plan so you didn't get into the question of how do you disperse what do you do, what's fair, what's not fair.",1
8," Mr. Chunkim, commissioners, do you have any questions?",
7, I guess my only question would be if the 11 tenants are consolidated to two floors. And they're aware of it. Would they?,
8, I don't know how.,
1," It's their choice. I mean, we would be giving them the option and we would pay for their move.",
7," got it.  If they're aware that they're consolidated to those two floors, I wouldn't, I guess what I'm trying to communicate is that there could be some tension because they wouldn't be aware that everyone that's not in those two floors are transient.  Um.",
1," you  I don't know that what we're trying to do is create a product for an area that is very special. And so I don't know that it would be, I'm not saying everyone else in the building would be. It could be that we're renting to new people who are aware that they're living in a potential transient building. And they could become permanent residents too. So the floor below them, floor above them could have different types of users. We've experienced this in New York. There are many of these types of buildings that exist. You'll see that some condominium or they can co-op buildings go into hotel pools. And when we've researched it and saw that, we saw that creating these sorts of house rules and having a mechanism for complaint and having rules that they get applied and having security accomplishes having a harmonious living environment for folks. Because that really at the end of the day was the question was how do you ensure a harmonious living environment?",
8," Commissioner Chunkham, so then to be clear, this would be a short term solution to some of the concerns that we had. So the existing 11 tenants at the moment, should they choose, you will consolidate them into two floors. Some time down the road, these two floors may also end up becoming transient use, depending on what the demand is.",
1," not bring the tendencies of those individuals. So if we have to have bacon units or they're not being rented by long-term tenants, then they won't be rented.",
8," got it. And then for long term, the solution would be just clear roles and expectations for  and short-term and yeah.",
1, And transfer them and...  and complete transparency in the process.,
8, Got it.  Okay.  Thank you.,
1, Thank you so much.,
8," Mr. Nanchankim, can we take a quick one minute recess while I have a procedural question? First stop.  So right now is 5.24 and we will resume in about a minute or so.  The time is 525 and we will resume from our recess. And so we actually have some cards for the public testimony, however, because the public testimony took place on August 8th, it's meeting unless there is a motion by the commissioners to open up public testimony and we can proceed with deliberation.  Okay, so then we will...  Deliberate.  If you have any new thoughts or a motion on the table.",
3," Commissioner Mendes, I'm not sure if this is a staff question or an applicant question, but  I want to sort of read  revisit the question as to why there wasn't something proposed as to how to divvy up and protect existing housing units with transitory units. I mean, is that something that  because we had asked for some sort of guidance recommendation if we wanted to move that direction on how to do it. And so just wanted to understand why that wasn't brought forth.",
2," I think there's two part questions. I'll answer one part, the other part out, defer to the applicant. Now, you see I'm asking, this is Jack John's own administrator. So, Commissioner Manidez is asking, still, why there is no...  It definitive number of units been divided up. I'll refer that to the applicant. But as far as your question relates to taking up the apartment use, OK? I want to clarify that this project does not remove the apartment use from the market.  It is still all this units are still apartment units. Okay? You but you...  I want to use award-empower to empower these units so that the property owner can serve a demand in the area to allow.  allowed 30 days of tenancy, under 30 days of tenancy, in case that there is a market demand. But the apartment use are still maintained. So there is really no removal of the apartment units or the housing stock from this property.",
8," Commissioner Chan Kim, I don't think it was necessarily the...  the removal of the apartment use, it was just the potential down the road, what can happen to  housing in general and more so than a specific number per say dedication to long-term versus the transient  It was just more of a guidance for any type of mechanism or a precedent in place that would help us somewhat navigate. You know, if we felt the need to  dedicate a portion of this to ensure that there is housing available. I think that was just kind of the overall concern of the commission and where we left off last time.  for this hearing where we were hoping to have that answer. And I think that's what Commissioner Men does is alluding to. If there's any.  We to derive such a number.  or a percentage or a ratio.",
3, Commissioner Mendez or how do we  protect existing housing stock so that it's not a number that's going down.,
2," I think the housing stock has, again, housing, this is Jack John, the zoning administrator. I don't think the housing stock has been removed from this property, so it's not going down. But in terms of the numbers, the percentage, I really have to defer that to the applicant. Now, you're asking about the housing stock in the region. That is a bigger question than this conditional use project. That is more of a community question and regional question and policy question. Now when you are asking the vacancy rate and also the population, that has to do with the census and the policy programs that the department has. So I don't want you to jam a big, big topic into a conditional use project. It just doesn't work. It doesn't work. I cannot answer the question based on that. Because even if you're considering removing a housing stock from this property, there will be other housing project coming up in the region. If it's not in Hollywood, it would be right, it would be community right next door. I mean, it would be adjacent community plan. We have a lot of a project in application or pipeline, you know, for small lots of division, new apartments, the communions, affordable housing, the project after this is affordable housing. I mean, there are a lot other housing projects coming in the pipeline to replace that. But what you're asking is bigger than  than the conditional use before us. Again, for the number of, if you only have a dedicated number of apartment units and tours, I have to defer that to the applicant.",
8," Commissioner Chunkham, thank you.",
2, Thank you.,
8," I mean,  For me personally, that logic does make sense because we're not removing the apartment use. We're adding a new use to it.  So the logic does make sense for me and in terms of the language in some of the conditions that  the commission felt needed clarification or just some clearing up I feel like the  suggested modifications that  you  staff provided suffice.",
7, Mm-hmm.,
8," you  you  And so...  I'm inclined to...  Well, actually I do have another question. So then these somewhat voluntary, if you can call it that, conditions from the applicant, how would we be able to implement that into?",
2," you  Impose as part of the conditions approval. I just don't use a war voluntary because a lot of times that application, the applicants will include voluntary condition. I'll just delete the war voluntary and then make that as part of my condition.",
8, because a lot of people are going to be here.,
6," or since they're next over last year's City Attorney's Office.  You can look at these three conditions and see if there's something in the findings that allow you to create, you know, what we call that nexus, you know, where we've discussed before in this commission. You know, what's the connection between these particular conditions and some effect of the project that, you know, according to the findings, you think needs to be addressed. So just as by way of guidance, if you look at finding number two, the projects location size high operations and other significant features, we'll be compatible with it. We'll not adversely affect refer to the degree adjacent properties surrounding neighborhood or the public health welfare and safety.  I think if you look at these three conditions that are proposed to be added to the project, and you look at the findings as currently drafted.  You may be able to articulate where these conditions fit in. For example, in paragraph two of the findings that's currently drafted, there's a discussion about existing tenants and about their current at least, agreements, really, and arrangements.  This first condition appears to me to...  be addressing issues related to what's being discussed in that second paragraph of finding number two.  Once again, now looking at the second proposed condition, the notice that the tends to be given that it's a mixed tenancy building and provided a rule of conduct, once again that might fall in under this second finding of making sure that this project is compatible with and will not further degrade adjacent properties, starting in neighborhood and so on.  the third  condition the  Member of Management staff being available, 24 hours a day at handle complaints. Once again, I fall into this same  to the law, GPI, and making this second finding the affirmative. So if the commission just wants to take a little bit of time to.  sort of digest what I've just said and see what you guys think in terms of these conditions, whether or not you think that there is, that next is that connection between these conditions.  some effect of the project that you think can be  addressed to these conditions.  I would just know on the subject of these conditions that the second condition regarding the rules of conduct, the portion a bit about the starts with that if breach would result in their immediate loss of right to occupy the premises.  Once again, I would just have the commission consider as far as enforcement goes. That seems like that might be something that's really between the less or and the less see and whether or not this commission wants to impose a condition. That seems more to go to the relationship between the less or less see just one thing to consider. Whether or not you think that language is appropriate and whether or not the city can effectively enforce that particular term of the condition.  Similar to that the three strike rule for complaints against such tenants and then being then asked to leave the premises once again I would just have the commission consider whether or not that's something that can be effectively and efficiently  you know, taking care of by the CEO whether or not that strikes the commission or something that really is between the lesser and the less e.",-1
3," Commissioner Mendes, question. So the reason that those were asked to be included was to address some of the safety concerns that existing tenants have. So.  Is there a way for us to include language around that?  gives the city or gives us some ability to put requirements around that that don't.  have those issues that you just described.",
6," Cesar Nusselvallasca City Attorney's Office, I have to think a little bit more about what language could be drafted to address that concern, but the concern that I just wanted to highlight to the commission was that  that issue of enforceability and  adopting and contracting conditions that can be  Uh...  that can be enforced with relative efficiency and effectiveness and those particular provisions just struck me as being a bit  difficult to",-1
4, Thank you.,
6," to police and not on the LAPD sense of the word, but police in the sense of just how do we how does it ensure that such a condition is complied with. The having a rules of conduct is something that  Bye.  that we can, I think, we can reasonably enforce, it could be some requirement that the applicant present those rules of conduct to the department of city planning or to the relevant city department. It's just the result of what a breach of those rules of conduct mean.  may put the city in a position where it's  interjecting itself into issues or disputes between a less or an LSE and that is what struck me as being potentially difficult to enforce. But if someone more creative than me, if you or maybe staffed in, come up with language that might address the concerns that I've highlighted but still.  Take care of, I think what you...  I hope such a condition might accomplish. Perhaps we can come up with something, but I unfortunately don't have anything off the top of my head right now that I could present to you, but I'm sure if you...  you know if you can try to work with staff and see if they can think of anything that might be  that might address your concern while still being something that can be effectively enforced.",-1
8," Mr. Chunkam, this is a  question that's been I think looming for me at least.  with Mr. Haynes also commenting earlier, but I mean, where is that line drawn in terms of enforcement and creating some sort of  repercussions if you can call it that for not complying because I mean in the case of the example that was brought up earlier if there is a non-compliance I don't feel like there is much language whether it's in the conditions itself or just  Maybe it's just a...  Deeper problem, but I mean yeah, there just seems to be very limited enforcement that we're able to  put.  on such matters before us. So where is that line? I know you're saying we're now going into like a private agreement area.",
6," because they're not so less considered attorney's office.  Like you mentioned, this commission hears appeals and generally hears appeals and that is the functions commission this commission doesn't obviously act to legal out and enforce the conditions that this commission may or may not impose.  You know, that's divided up between different, you know, separate bodies of the city, you know, DBS being one of them that receives complaints alleging zoning code violation then goes out and investigates them.  you know, in your...  So, for a successful example, it would be sort of for these rules of conduct that you could have a requirement that the applicants submit these rules. So, did you know that they've actually been drafted? That's something that I think can be...  enforced and proof of compliance with that can be reasonably shown.",
0, Haha.,
6," Like to my point with this simply to highlight that  the commission just consider whether or not these particular conditions are currently drafted with another language in there that  should be removed because.  They don't lend themselves to...  If the Netherlands was either efficient enforcement or it puts the city in a position where it's arbitrating dispute between  you know, the person who's renting and the person who's, you know, the less in the less or and that's what's the point I wanted to make.  The point of enforcement is obviously a much larger.  issue that  you know, I sit here in this truck and, you know, give you the...  Mr. Chan-Chi-Len.",
8," Mr. Chang-Chan, well then to get a little bit more specific to this particular, I think you're looking at the second bullet point. So I guess where I am confused is what's the difference between outlining.  the quiet hours, right, commencing at 10 PM on week days and 11 PM on weekend, versus a three-staric rule for complaints. I guess I'm just not seeing, because to me they're equally specific.",
6," the nurse for the last G.C.D. Chinese Office.  I think the issue that I wanted to highlight is having a rules of conduct that outline when quiet hours being your 10 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on weekends.  It's something that is very precise. You can have the applicant submit these rules of conduct, and it states clearly that quite hours are from 10 p.m.  on the weekdays and 11 p.m. on the weekends, when it comes to sort of three strikes in your out sort of a role.  my concern with was that the commissioners currently drafted  doesn't explain what a strike is for.  you know we heard from the outlook today that it was over 30 day period so once again the condition has crumly drafted didn't have that so that was my concern that seemed that it was a bit vague as far as what a strike um...  would be categorized as a strike and  That...  it would then put the city in a position where it would be  under these conditions seems that it would be enforcing  The...  You know the repercussions for these violations framing three strikes, whereas that seemed to be more of an issue between  Like said, the less one, the less E2.  decide what sort of repercussions should result from violations of the rules of conduct. Establishing rules of conduct, I think something that is within the purview of this commission and something that can be presented.  to planning step-to-show. These are the rules of conduct. These are quiet hours. These are, you know, whatever other rules. You know, these are the rules that people are expected to abide by while staying at this particular site.  but issues of removing short-term tenants or three strikes in your route.  seem to be more an issue between.  the applicant as the one who's.  putting the units up for rent and then those people who then decide to rent those units.  So that was the distinction I was making between just having quite hours to start at 10pm on the weekdays and 11pm on the weekends. That's something that can be clearly put out, you know, in a short paragraph from bullet point on, a rules of conduct, but this issue of three strikes and what is a strike? Just seem to be a little...  to unclear as currently drafted. And I just wanted to highlight that to the commission as a  as a point that maybe unclear at the moment.  Commissioner.",
3," Commissioner Mendes, I think the one possible solution to this would be.  to eliminate  specifics like that and require that rules of conduct be created, but also that there be some sort of complaint process for existing tenants so that  as issues come up as part of this transition that  existing tenants have a right to or have an ability to communicate that and have those needs addressed.",
2," All right, staff, zoning minister is out. So the housing department currently enforce the housing conditions and regulations. So if there's any nuisance or current side, the tenant can always contact the city to enforce any sort of a nuisance, okay? So but I do agree with the city attorney in regards to the three strike rule, okay? I propose I went delete that attorney in regards to the three strike rule. I propose I won't delete that because in case there is a dispute between the tenants and property owner, then City will be dragged in. And that will not be involved in between the private contract. Now this is different than the City regulation, the LEMC, whereas the fence case, the regulation comes from the LEMC, so the city has to enforce that. But this thing is basically agreement created by two private properties. And I don't think that there's a place for that in all condition. So having the choir, the ruse of conduct makes sense, but that's the three strike rule.",
0, you  Uh huh.  and,
2," Yeah. And housing department, housing department enforcement, that's again, that's a regulatory compliance. I mean, that's just like building in safety. I don't think that we need to add additional language for something that City already does.",
8," understand.  Yes, I just wanted to commission on Chunk Kim.  get a better understanding, especially when you say go through and check for this type of language that we fully understand the thought process of what kind of language it is that you're asking us to look for. Before we go into searching for all applicable findings, Commissioner Delgado, did you have any input and sites, questions?",
7," Commissioner Doug out of no, I don't.",
8," Commissioner Tronkin, so if we're all in agreement, I think the next step would be taking a couple moments to look through the findings and see how they apply to these three bullet points.",
6, And that's the Alaska City Attorney's Office and it appreciates me that the third bullet point I think it's already at least according to staff's presentation already covered by the proposed modification of condition number 15. So I think that the room may be duplicative of condition number 15. But I'll let staff chime in if that is correct. Correct. Correct. Yes.,
3, Thank you.,
2, Thank you.,
6, Thank you.,
2, Thank you.,
6, you,
2," I'm sorry. The third bullet points is already covered. Yeah, it's covered by the condition number 15 So I think that we can strike that",
3, that's the...  Yeah.,
2," I can revise the second bullet point so that it will be  more appropriate.  just contain the Rs, that the property owner provide rules of conduct and then they are showing the quiet Rs starting at 11 PM. And for a vision of alcohol, drinking smoke or any.  of any kind outside or private residence, then that's it.",
8," Commissioner Tonkin, while we're on that second bullet point, I'm being nitpicky, but can we make sure it's as quiet?",
2," Yeah.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's quiet.",
4," Excuse me, you are...",
8," turn.  Commissioner and Tom Kim sorry we had our public testimony for the last hearing and so for this continuance we actually don't need to open up public testimony unless there is a motion by one of the commissioners to do so.  Thanks.  Commissioner Tonkant, there is no public testimony at this time and we're deliberating.",
3," Commissioner Medes, just to understand what we're doing right now, we're looking through the findings and seeing how we can.  um, fit them to the men there.  Thank you.",
8," Commissioner Chunkham, so for these two bullet points, I've removed the third one since it's a duplicate.  In order for us to actually make these part of the conditions of the CUP, we would have to find that if it's within the findings.  And so  If we are in agreement that we want these two bullet points submitted to us by the applicant to be part of the conditions, then we would have to.  He wanted to say find the finding.",
5, This is Jane Choi with the Planning Department. Can I make a suggestion for finding? Sure. So I think in finding number one regarding the project will enhance.,
8, Sure.,
5," the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or will perform a function or provide a service that is essential or beneficial to the community, city or region. So I think it's already established in the finding that  the project will provide a service.  that is essential or beneficial to the community, city, or region. But if you look on page 14,  actually at the bottom of page 13.  and continuing on to page 14, it talks about  allowing short-term rentals while maintaining the apartment use would make an efficient and flexible use and it continues on.  to talk about how the project would preserve long-term housing while addressing short-term.  residential occupancy issues. I would suggest adding a paragraph after that that talks about how at the hearing in the Area Planning Commission issues were raised regarding  the compatibility of  ability having both long-term leases and short-term leases.  and to address that, the commission is adding these two conditions to  allow for better noticing of  for our...  tenons both long term and short term.  to address the issues that were raised during the public testimony.",
8," Mr. Tunkim, so can we just see you?  you  what you just said.  I'm going to refer back to your statement.  I have it then.  Okay.  there.",
6," This is Ernesto Velasquez City Terms Office. Even when you make your motion, you can.  refer back to  senior city planner Jane Choi's comments and adopt those as the and adopt those or adopt those but just refer back to them when you're making your motion and incorporating these additional conditions into the approval.",
8," Commissioner Tonkham, so would any of the commissioners like to make a motion?",
7," I'd love to, Commissioner Dogaro, it's a little complicated. If you want to start me off, be glad to take it home. But I want to make sure that I have the overall framework of what it is that we've agreed to, and then how we can...  on the record kick it back to planning.",
8," you  Commissioner Chong Kim. So we would be making a motion to grant the appeal and part.  and then...  It's in part because we will be adding new conditions and revising conditions 11, 12, 13 and 15. So adding the two conditions that were...  submitted to us by the applicant with the findings that senior sitting plenner, Jane Joy, made.  Does that help?  No.  No. Okay.  Commissioner Tunkim, I'll make the most. All right. Thank you.",
0, Thank you.  you,
8," Commissioner Chung-Kim, I make a motion to grant the appeal and part.  Determined based on the whole of the administrative record that the project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Article 3, Section 1, Class 1, Category 22 of the CEQA guidelines and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical exception pursuant to CEQA guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies. Grantee appeal in part and sustain in part the zoning administrators' determination to approve a conditional use permit to allow a transient occupancy residential structure addition to an existing residential dwelling use within 500 feet. Adopt the conditions of approval as modified by the commission.  and adopt the findings with the modifications suggested by the senior city planner, Jane Choi.",
4, until we have seconds.,
7," Commissioner Dugout, I second the motion.",
4," At Orange Dung CEA, we have our first and second motion on the floor. Commissioner Chan Kim, how do you vote?",
8, Yes.,
