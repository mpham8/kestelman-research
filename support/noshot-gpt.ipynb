    "\t•\t“This will add jobs, but it also displaces residents.” → Likely neutral (2)\n",
    "\t•\tUnrelated or Procedural Comments: If a comment discusses general meeting logistics, requests for clarification, or unrelated concerns, classify as neutral (2).\n",

So these are the items I request by the commission last time to amend, okay additional item that I submitted to you is  Similar type of cases that will approve because that was a question asked by the commissioner and also I believe that Helen also have a similar that same same question so I Ask our ZAs in the department if they have done any Trans-Analcuban Z-Rest-Entre-Structure projects in the past few years Only Maya Zazefsky replying and she has done one that she approved back in 2013. The project was it's a locating of Venice planning area and it's a conversion.  from the residential apartment into the tours, the transient occupancy, residential structure. It's not exactly the same as the project before you because the project before you maintains both apartment and the tours use, but this one is a complete  conversion. Okay.  I also mentioned that there is a project located on Wojšer, right, right around the MacArthur Park area. I call the applicant and that project never penciled out so it did not become an application. However, what I want to present to you is a joint memo issued by a joint department memo issued by the Planning Department and also  Building safety on February 27th, 2014. Now, this memo basically stays that general plan visioned this route and new  Regional center and district will be the most densely developed.  in Los Angeles and characterised by lively mixed residential commercial and detainment retail and visitors serving uses to help realise this vision. The exception, okay, this memo is to relax the citywide regulation government permitted uses of land and yard requirement for the buildings. Now this memo is stipulated at a hotel, a apartment hotel in CRC1C.5C2C4 and C5 zones. Basically covers all the commercial area. In the central city community plan area or area designated by the community plan as regional center or regional commercial. Okay.  to be exempted with conditional use. Okay, so even a hotel, a part of a hotel is located within 500 feet of an arson. So if you have a project that's located,  Ian  This is a red hatch area. That's a regional center commercial. So this covers the entire downtown. And areas are a long washer boulevard from downtown all the way to Korea town, Western Avenue.  and also  majority area of Hollywood, okay, community, the hatch area.  Project like this, okay, but conforming.  to the criteria if it's a new construction or adapt to reuse, okay, or conversion existing buildings to allow  Um  that has a historical significance, you don't need the conditional use. So my point is that there could be a lot of this project that all they need is just go to building and safety, who a building permit without coming to planning department for a conditional use. Okay. So this project that before you, I don't think qualifies for this.  this memo, but I want to illustrate the fact that there must be a lot of a tourist project.  in the cities of system, that's not before us. And in order to find out, that has to be a search through building premise system.  Okay.  So.  that's all I want to say in regards to the possible distype of cases that occurs in the city. Now for the Mitchell-Politan law,  My feeling is that this is a unique area. It's a unique use. In other area, I will not consider a proof of it, but this project basically serves a creative office use. That's why it's very different. Okay, and I think it's important to maintain the apartment use on site as well. Because this is not a typical hotel use. Now you're got to hear, I think you probably see a couple letters from the Hollywood Chambers and the other one from the NABU Council.  Thank you and for your late neighborhood council.  Thank you.  They talk about the hotel use.  To me, I think this is a very different from the hotel use because this allows, this course, especially for this project, allows longer stay. This is not geared towards a visitor for a couple of days.  These people may stay on site for two weeks, three weeks, maybe two months. Okay?  I think the use is very important to cover both on the 30 days and over 30 days. Because if you do not allow the apartment use, then the tenants outside, when it crossed the 30 days, then basically,  city city does not enforce any sort of a tendency of inside a hotel over 30 days, but city does  enforce the housing actions and housing regulation on apartments that's if it's for short-term rentals. So if it tenants,  stay if you don't maintain a hotel. I mean the apartment use in the tenant stays over 30 days then Nobody's overseeing nobody's overseeing the tenant rights as an apartment do all are okay But I think it's also very important to to approve this project because there is an absolute it absolute need in this area to to provide Sort of a and transient occupancy residence structure for  in  a sort of a longer, longer-term short-term stays. Okay? This is not a hotel use. Okay? So, even though people are trying to sell you that, the area needs a hotel or there may be other hotel projects coming in, but this is not exactly a hotel use. Okay? So, I think that basically concludes my comments for this project.\n",

But as far as how many units were permanently assigned to apartments and how many units were permanently assigned to the tours, I don't think that we have that information available. So I still maintain that the applicant, it's the property owner still want to do all 52 units as an apartment, both apartments and tours use.

I believe Commissioner Chimorinsky was saying that there has to be some sort of  So, I just added that the applicant  shall not display or be evictive without just cause. So that if the tenant breach the lease agreement as to become nuisance or become the, becomes, or endangered properties or not pay rent, then they can be evicted. But that's why I just add the phrase without just cause as to breach lease agreement. So the lease agreement itself will have terms. So I'm just keeping the language sort of a flexible. Now condition number two, there was a question in regards to the 30 days and 60 days. Now which type of tenants should be served with 30 days or which type of tenants should be served with 60 days. Then I checked the California Department's consumer affairs. It has regulation in regards to the noticing. Now if you  It doesn't, the notice was served to tenet. It, that doesn't matter what type of lease agreement you have. Whether it's months to months or it's a yearly lease, it does not matter. But what matter is how long have you stay on the property? So if you stay on the property for less than one year, then 30 days notice applies. If you, if you have to live on the property for more than a year, 12 months, then 60 days leads will apply. I mean, 60 days notice will apply. So I basically, I change the language. I'd be more clear that the applicant shall comply to the California Department of Consumer Affair and Noticing Requirement, okay?  allow the tenants to stay up additional 30 days, okay, beyond the terms of tenancy, okay, in case they are  relocating.

All right, so I add that. The last condition is number 15, that on site manager, I just say that available for 24 hours a day. Now that is already a part of the determination.  Now this is...  The on-site manager is required by the state law for any apartment that's more than 16 units. You have to have a 24 hour on-site manager. This is basically a regulatory compliance measure.

We started thinking through a business plan and I think Commissioner Delgado kind of hit the nail on the head in some ways of saying, well, you know, what's fair? How do you divide things up? What floors do you put them on in the like?  And the way we started thinking about it from a business model perspective was for those people who have been there and were not subjected to a transient occupancy near them, it is unfair or potentially unfair to expose them to it without having a consolidated floor that is dedicated to them.  tenants left that we would move to two consolidated floors.  thereafter and those floors would remain such until such time as those tenants have either left or tenancy or not.  Then people who come in terms of the marketplace, we would provide, you'll see that in our business plan, there's a series of notices that are required. And the notices were meant to inform both individuals who want to rent on a long-term basis that this is an effect of a mixed apartment building and that there may be people who are a temporary occupant near them. And if so, these are their rights. And these are the ways that they can have complaints and these is how we will take care of them. And that way, they can make the decision on whether to rent the apartment or not. And if they're renting it, they're renting it with knowledge that they could be living next to someone who is a temporary occupant. On the flip side of that, we wanted to also notify the temporary occupants that they are living in a building that could have permanent residents and as such there is a code of conduct relative to that and given that there are temporary which would mean that they're less than 30 days there's a we've imposed a three strike rule if there's three complaints against the temporary resident they're out with without question you know and it would be three strikes within that 30 day period. That way ensuring that we are both serving the community that we are not going to be able to do that. We are not going to be able to do that without question, you know, and it would be three strikes within that 30-day period. That way ensuring that we are both serving the community that we want and providing the most flexibility for the building because the reality is as Mr. Chang identified, this is a very special part of Hollywood and we believe it serves a population of the studios in the entertainment industry and trying to be fair to the residents that exist there, giving them a longer term, allowing them to be on a separate floor during their whole tenancy and thereafter making sure that everyone is aware of the rules of the game. And that seemed like the wisest business plan so you didn't get into the question of how do you disperse what do you do, what's fair, what's not fair.\n",

So the floor below them, floor above them could have different types of users. We've experienced this in New York. There are many of these types of buildings that exist. You'll see that some condominium or they can co-op buildings go into hotel pools. And when we've researched it and saw that, we saw that creating these sorts of house rules and having a mechanism for complaint and having rules that they get applied and having security accomplishes having a harmonious living environment for folks.

You know, if we felt the need to  dedicate a portion of this to ensure that there is housing available. I think that was just kind of the overall concern of the commission and where we left off last time.  for this hearing where we were hoping to have that answer.

I don't think the housing stock has been removed from this property, so it's not going down. But in terms of the numbers, the percentage, I really have to defer that to the applicant. Now, you're asking about the housing stock in the region. That is a bigger question than this conditional use project. That is more of a community question and regional question and policy question. Now when you are asking the vacancy rate and also the population, that has to do with the census and the policy programs that the department has. So I don't want you to jam a big, big topic into a conditional use project. It just doesn't work. It doesn't work. I cannot answer the question based on that. Because even if you're considering removing a housing stock from this property, there will be other housing project coming up in the region. If it's not in Hollywood, it would be right, it would be community right next door. I mean, it would be adjacent community plan. We have a lot of a project in application or pipeline, you know, for small lots of division, new apartments, the communions, affordable housing, the project after this is affordable housing. I mean, there are a lot other housing projects coming in the pipeline to replace that. But what you're asking is bigger than  than the conditional use before us.

You can look at these three conditions and see if there's something in the findings that allow you to create, you know, what we call that nexus, you know, where we've discussed before in this commission. You know, what's the connection between these particular conditions and some effect of the project that, you know, according to the findings, you think needs to be addressed. So just as by way of guidance, if you look at finding number two, the projects location size high operations and other significant features, we'll be compatible with it. We'll not adversely affect refer to the degree adjacent properties surrounding neighborhood or the public health welfare and safety.  I think if you look at these three conditions that are proposed to be added to the project, and you look at the findings as currently drafted.  You may be able to articulate where these conditions fit in. For example, in paragraph two of the findings that's currently drafted, there's a discussion about existing tenants and about their current at least, agreements, really, and arrangements.  This first condition appears to me to...  be addressing issues related to what's being discussed in that second paragraph of finding number two.  Once again, now looking at the second proposed condition, the notice that the tends to be given that it's a mixed tenancy building and provided a rule of conduct, once again that might fall in under this second finding of making sure that this project is compatible with and will not further degrade adjacent properties, starting in neighborhood and so on.  the third  condition the  Member of Management staff being available, 24 hours a day at handle complaints. Once again, I fall into this same  to the law, GPI, and making this second finding the affirmative. So if the commission just wants to take a little bit of time to.  sort of digest what I've just said and see what you guys think in terms of these conditions, whether or not you think that there is, that next is that connection between these conditions.  some effect of the project that you think can be  addressed to these conditions.  I would just know on the subject of these conditions that the second condition regarding the rules of conduct, the portion a bit about the starts with that if breach would result in their immediate loss of right to occupy the premises.  Once again, I would just have the commission consider as far as enforcement goes. That seems like that might be something that's really between the less or and the less see and whether or not this commission wants to impose a condition. That seems more to go to the relationship between the less or less see just one thing to consider. Whether or not you think that language is appropriate and whether or not the city can effectively enforce that particular term of the condition.  Similar to that the three strike rule for complaints against such tenants and then being then asked to leave the premises once again I would just have the commission consider whether or not that's something that can be effectively and efficiently  you know, taking care of by the CEO whether or not that strikes the commission or something that really is between the lesser and the less e.\n",

      "Index 256:  or since they're next over last year's City Attorney's Office.  You can look at these three conditions and see if there's something in the findings that allow you to create, you know, what we call that nexus, you know, where we've discussed before in this commission. You know, what's the connection between these particular conditions and some effect of the project that, you know, according to the findings, you think needs to be addressed. So just as by way of guidance, if you look at finding number two, the projects location size high operations and other significant features, we'll be compatible with it. We'll not adversely affect refer to the degree adjacent properties surrounding neighborhood or the public health welfare and safety.  I think if you look at these three conditions that are proposed to be added to the project, and you look at the findings as currently drafted.  You may be able to articulate where these conditions fit in. For example, in paragraph two of the findings that's currently drafted, there's a discussion about existing tenants and about their current at least, agreements, really, and arrangements.  This first condition appears to me to...  be addressing issues related to what's being discussed in that second paragraph of finding number two.  Once again, now looking at the second proposed condition, the notice that the tends to be given that it's a mixed tenancy building and provided a rule of conduct, once again that might fall in under this second finding of making sure that this project is compatible with and will not further degrade adjacent properties, starting in neighborhood and so on.  the third  condition the  Member of Management staff being available, 24 hours a day at handle complaints. Once again, I fall into this same  to the law, GPI, and making this second finding the affirmative. So if the commission just wants to take a little bit of time to.  sort of digest what I've just said and see what you guys think in terms of these conditions, whether or not you think that there is, that next is that connection between these conditions.  some effect of the project that you think can be  addressed to these conditions.  I would just know on the subject of these conditions that the second condition regarding the rules of conduct, the portion a bit about the starts with that if breach would result in their immediate loss of right to occupy the premises.  Once again, I would just have the commission consider as far as enforcement goes. That seems like that might be something that's really between the less or and the less see and whether or not this commission wants to impose a condition. That seems more to go to the relationship between the less or less see just one thing to consider. Whether or not you think that language is appropriate and whether or not the city can effectively enforce that particular term of the condition.  Similar to that the three strike rule for complaints against such tenants and then being then asked to leave the premises once again I would just have the commission consider whether or not that's something that can be effectively and efficiently  you know, taking care of by the CEO whether or not that strikes the commission or something that really is between the lesser and the less e.\n",
      "Index 258:  Cesar Nusselvallasca City Attorney's Office, I have to think a little bit more about what language could be drafted to address that concern, but the concern that I just wanted to highlight to the commission was that  that issue of enforceability and  adopting and contracting conditions that can be  Uh...  that can be enforced with relative efficiency and effectiveness and those particular provisions just struck me as being a bit  difficult to\n",

The having a rules of conduct is something that  Bye.  that we can, I think, we can reasonably enforce, it could be some requirement that the applicant present those rules of conduct to the department of city planning or to the relevant city department. It's just the result of what a breach of those rules of conduct mean.  may put the city in a position where it's  interjecting itself into issues or disputes between a less or an LSE and that is what struck me as being potentially difficult to enforce. But if someone more creative than me, if you or maybe staffed in, come up with language that might address the concerns that I've highlighted but still.  Take care of, I think what you...  I hope such a condition might accomplish. Perhaps we can come up with something, but I unfortunately don't have anything off the top of my head right now that I could present to you, but I'm sure if you...  you know if you can try to work with staff and see if they can think of anything that might be  that might address your concern while still being something that can be effectively enforced.\n",

      "Index 9:  So staff recommends denying the appeal and the project description.  It's for 39 residential units in the Hollywood community plan area. Point City of Place, this is just south of Sunset Boulevard and east of La Brea. It's a vacant site and it's 39 total units, 36 market rate and three affordable units. They were eligible for two incentives, a 20% decrease in the required front yard, allowing a depth of 12 feet and a 20% increase in the allowable FAR from 3 to 1 to 3.6 to 1, and it includes 78 parking spaces and complies with all other municipal code sections.  So state density bonus law states that when an applicant seeks a density bonus, the city is required to grant it unless the appellant can prove that either the incentives are not necessary for inclusion of the affordable units or that there's a detrimental impact on physical safety and the environment.  owner of the building directly.  to the south of the site and the appeal points had to do with environmental uses and conditions that were mitigated in the mitigated negative declaration. So the appeal points had to do with noise and dust during construction and then a couple of process issues.  This is the site. It just shows that it's a vacant site and it's surrounded by  other multifamily residential uses.  This shows that the residential area, it's R3 zoning, and then it's commercial, just a long-sense at Boulevard to the north of the site.  These are some pictures of the site. This is the actual vacant site with the building to the west of it.  This is the adjacent property on the north side by sunset boulevard. And this is the south, the property of the south, which is the appellance property.  This is across the street from the subject property just a typical multi-family building in the area.  And then we have some drawings that we included earlier today in your packet. And I'm good. I was going to have Nicole Sanchez, the staff planner come up and just walk you through. The findings are made based on design guidelines in the Hollywood community plan. And that's what the director's determination did was was look for facade articulation. But this just shows you I'll just have her walk you through the plans.\n",
      "Index 10:  after a new commissioners, Nicole Sanchez with the Pioneer Department. So the slide that you see here is the front elevation of the building facing east onto Punxeria Place.  As previously mentioned, this project is a density bonus project, therefore it complies with section 12.22, 825 of the LEMC.  which requires any density bonus project with on menu incentives to comply with certain design features.  This project also incorporates some of the Hollywood Community Plan Design Guidelines, as well as the Planning Department's City of White Residential Design Guidelines.  Some of those guidelines include articulation on the facade that are but a street with a change in material, textures or a break and plane.\n",
      "Index 14:  Okay.  So here is a summary of the appeal points that we received.  They're primarily related to the short-term construction impacts.  which have all been mitigated either through the M&D or conditioned in the director's determination.  So once again, we recommend denial of the appeal and sustaining the director's donation, approving, identity bonus compliance review. Great.\n",
      "Index 47:  So the appeal points, we responded since the appeal points had to do with impacts related to construction, such as noise and dust. And there were some points there that had to do with the process that we were just talking about. We, since an emitting a neck deck was prepared for it, the mitigation measures addressed all of the appeal points. And that was how we responded and recommended, it made our recommendation to deny the appeal.\n",

So air pollution, demolition, grading, and construction activities were addressed, you know, such as  transported off site and wetting the dust, the standard mitigation measures for construction dirt.

      "Index 116:  Hello, everyone. My name is Lucerito Martinez. I'm the project planner assigned to the case. The project consists of the demolition of an existing single family home and the subsequent construction of a three-story eight-unit apartment building with a semi-subterranean garage. It will provide a total of 15 parking spaces. The requested entitlements include a zone change from R1-1 to R3-1 to construct the 8-unit apartment building and also include say 15-foot building line removal created by ordinance 1-29661. The recommendation is to approve the categorical exemption class 32, the zone change from R1-1 to TQR3-1.  and the building line removal. And I'm here to answer any questions.\n",
      "Index 230:  Mr. Chang made an adequate description of what we thought about. We started thinking through a business plan and I think Commissioner Delgado kind of hit the nail on the head in some ways of saying, well, you know, what's fair? How do you divide things up? What floors do you put them on in the like?  And the way we started thinking about it from a business model perspective was for those people who have been there and were not subjected to a transient occupancy near them, it is unfair or potentially unfair to expose them to it without having a consolidated floor that is dedicated to them.  tenants left that we would move to two consolidated floors.  thereafter and those floors would remain such until such time as those tenants have either left or tenancy or not.  Then people who come in terms of the marketplace, we would provide, you'll see that in our business plan, there's a series of notices that are required. And the notices were meant to inform both individuals who want to rent on a long-term basis that this is an effect of a mixed apartment building and that there may be people who are a temporary occupant near them. And if so, these are their rights. And these are the ways that they can have complaints and these is how we will take care of them. And that way, they can make the decision on whether to rent the apartment or not. And if they're renting it, they're renting it with knowledge that they could be living next to someone who is a temporary occupant. On the flip side of that, we wanted to also notify the temporary occupants that they are living in a building that could have permanent residents and as such there is a code of conduct relative to that and given that there are temporary which would mean that they're less than 30 days there's a we've imposed a three strike rule if there's three complaints against the temporary resident they're out with without question you know and it would be three strikes within that 30 day period. That way ensuring that we are both serving the community that we are not going to be able to do that. We are not going to be able to do that without question, you know, and it would be three strikes within that 30-day period. That way ensuring that we are both serving the community that we want and providing the most flexibility for the building because the reality is as Mr. Chang identified, this is a very special part of Hollywood and we believe it serves a population of the studios in the entertainment industry and trying to be fair to the residents that exist there, giving them a longer term, allowing them to be on a separate floor during their whole tenancy and thereafter making sure that everyone is aware of the rules of the game. And that seemed like the wisest business plan so you didn't get into the question of how do you disperse what do you do, what's fair, what's not fair.\n"
