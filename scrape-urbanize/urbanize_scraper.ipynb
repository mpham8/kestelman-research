Leveraged with other sources, the money will help to spur nearly $550 million in total developments, creating 780 new homes.\n",
      "The projects include:\n",
      "Holos Communities is set to receive nearly $4.5 million in No Place Like Home funds for Bellamontes, a project which would redevelop a former National Guard facility at 244 George Hensel Drive in Montebello into a 57-unit affordable housing complex.  According to a landing page on the Holos Communities website, the project is a mix of adaptive reuse and new construction, incorporating the historic armory building while adding prefabricated wood panels and modules at the exterior.\n",
      "Coupled with approximately $32.8 million in other funding resources, the project is expected to cost $37.3 million in total.\n",
      "In El Monte, National CORE is set to receive $18 million from the County for Esperanza Village, the redevelopment of part of the MacLaren Children's Center. Plans call for a series of three-story buildings which would include 202 apartments for families and seniors at the low- and extremely low-income levels.\n",
      "National CORE must secure $120.3 million from other sources to cover the estimated $138.3 million cost of the project.\n",
      "West Hollywood Community Housing has been allocated $4.5 million for the construction of its Fourth Clover apartments, which would rise from a property at 3651-3663 W. Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. The total cost of the project is estimated at $65.9 million.\n",
      "According to the company's website, plans call for an 89-unit building featuring a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments reserved flow low-income households and formerly homeless renters. Construction is set to begin in Winter 2025 and conclude by Winter 2027.\n",
      "In Hollywood, A Community of Friends will receive $5.3 million for the redevelopment of the Selby Hotel at 1740 N. Hudson Avenue. The total cost of the venture is estimated at $50.7 million.\n",
      "According to the Housing Department website, plans call for an eight-story building featuring 65 studio, one-, and two-bedroom apartments.\n",
      "Mercy Housing California is set to receive $3.6 million for its 300 Alamitos development in Long Beach. The approximately $54.6 million project would consist of a five-story building featuring 82 senior apartments and 32 parking spaces.\n",
      "In San Pedro, 1010 Development Corporation is slated for $4.3 million for its Hope on 6th project at 576 W. 6th Street. Plans call for 54 studio, one-, and two-bedroom apartments in a five-story structure.\n",
      "The total cost of the project is approximately $40.8 million.\n",
      "National CORE is slated to receive an additional $5 million to support the St. Ambrose Senior Housing development at 830 W. Bonita Avenue in Claremont. The $31.4 million project would include 59 apartments for older adults.\n",
      "According to a project website, the property would cater to renters aged 62 and older in the low-income category. The project is being built on land owned by St. Ambrose Episcopal Church, and is expected to begin work in 2026 and open by early 2028.\n",
      "Finally, National CORE will secure nearly $8.2 million for its proposed senior affordable housing complex at 280 Ramona Street in Pasadena.\n",
      "The $82.6 -million development, which would rise across the street from Pasadena City Hall, calls for the construction of a  five-story, 100-unit apartment building without on-site parking. The complex would include studio and one-bedroom dwellings for low-income senior households and senior citizens experiencing homelessness.\n",
      "East Rancho Apartments\n",
      "The Coalition for Responsible Community Development is set to receive $6.1 million in No Place Like Home funds for the East Rancho Apartments, which would bring 72 units of supportive housing to an as yet unspecified site in unincorporated Compton.
