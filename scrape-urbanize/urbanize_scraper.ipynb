      "Article Body: A presentation scheduled for the April 12 meeting of the Pasadena Design Commission offers a look at updated plans for Huntington Hospital's proposed medical office building at 758-766 Fair Oaks Avenue - a short walk east from its main campus.\n",
      "The project, which would rise from a corner lot at the intersection of Fair Oaks and Fillmore Street, calls for the construction of a four-story edifice featuring just over 100,000 square feet of medical offices and ancillary uses above a three-level subterranean parking garage with capacity for roughly 200 vehicles.\n",
      "As with the earlier iteration of the project presented to the Design Commission in November 2020, Mascari Warner Dinh has been retained as architect.\n",
      "\"The proposed new building is of a contemporary design with a flat roof, curving and articulated massing, extensive curtain wall glazing juxtaposed against solid framing volumes, and a strong, projecting roofline with extended canopies,\" reads a description of the design concept in a staff report to the Commission.\n",
      "While the project remains functionally similar to the earlier version, with a glass curtain wall system on its western facade, the primary change is to its street interaction. Gone is a proposed automobile drop off zone cutting a diagonal swath between Fair Oaks and Fillmore, replaced instead with a building that meets the sidewalk with a terrace above. At the intersection, a landscaped pedestrian plaza replaces what would have otherwise been an isolated island of concrete.\n",
      "The staff report, citing changes that have addressed earlier critiques of the design, have recommended that the Commission should approve the project's concept design review.\n",
      "The project is one of a handful of new medical office buildings in the works between Huntington Hospital and Metro's Fillmore Station a short walk east.\n",

      "The latest project, slated for a property at 590 Fair Oaks Avenue, calls for demolishing  small commercial building and a surface parking lot to make way for a new four-story edifice featuring nearly 100,000 square feet of medical office space above subterranean parking for 212 vehicles. \n",

The building is described as being of a contemporary style, with a commanding presence at the intersection of Fair Oaks and California Boulevard.  A metallic ribbon, wrapping up, down, and around the building is a central element to the design, which calls for placing a vehicular entrance on an alley off the eastern property line and a new east-west pedestrian paseo at street level to the south.\n",
      "A staff report recommends approval of the concept design for 590 Fair Oaks, with a condition for further refinement as the project advanced toward its final review at a future date.\n",

      "Article Body: On September 26, the Pasadena Design Commission is scheduled to review the newest plan to convert the 1920s Julia Morgan-designed YWCA Building into a boutique hotel.\n",
      "More than one decade ago, the City of Pasadena began soliciting interest from developers for the conversion of the property, which sits southwest of Pasadena City Hall at 78 N. Marengo Street. Those efforts crystallized into a plan from Kimpton Hotels to reactivate the historic property, only to see plans fizzle after the hotel chain sought more than $30-million in development incentives.\n",
      "The revised plan, which comes from HRI Hospitality Investments, calls for both the adaptive reuse of the 41,500 square-foot YWCA building, as well as the new construction of a five-story building on what is now a parking lot next door. Combined, the two buildings will contain a total of 217 hotel rooms - the bulk of which would be located in the new construction.\n",
      "The design team for the project includes ESa and Olin. Plans call for retaining and restoring the Morgan-designed building, which is of the Spanish Colonial Revival, while expanding the property with a new building described as a \"contemporary interpretation\" of its historic neighbor.  The new construction would maintain the existing central courtyard of the YWCA building, while also providing new open space at the roof level.\n",
      "The presentation to the Design Commission is for a preliminary review, in which commissioners will provide feedback and critiques on the design concept - including issues identified in a staff report.\n",
      "New plans for the YWCA building spawned from a 2019 request for proposals issued by the City of Pasadena seeking development options for two properties in its Civic Center. Among those is another property adjacent to City Hall at 280 Ramona Street, where National CORE is planning a five-story, 100-unit senior affordable housing complex.\n",
      "Several other properties in close proximity to the Civic Center, including a parking lot across the street from the hotel site, are also up for redevelopment with housing and commercial uses.\n",
