The building is described as being of a contemporary style, with a commanding presence at the intersection of Fair Oaks and California Boulevard.  A metallic ribbon, wrapping up, down, and around the building is a central element to the design, which calls for placing a vehicular entrance on an alley off the eastern property line and a new east-west pedestrian paseo at street level to the south.\n",

Plans call for the razing of a small commercial building and a surface parking lot to make way for the construction of a new four-story edifice featuring nearly 100,000 square feet of medical office space above a 212-car subsurface parking garage.\n",

      "\"The site is highly visible from Fair Oaks and California on three sides and each elevation is intended to respond to views to and from the site as well as its solar orientation,\" reads a design summary provided to the Commission by Smith Group.  \"Passive solar control is provided through delicate exterior louvers that reduce solar gain and maximize interior occupant comfort and building transparency.\"\n",

      "Article Body: On September 26, the Pasadena Design Commission is scheduled to review the newest plan to convert the 1920s Julia Morgan-designed YWCA Building into a boutique hotel.\n",
      "More than one decade ago, the City of Pasadena began soliciting interest from developers for the conversion of the property, which sits southwest of Pasadena City Hall at 78 N. Marengo Street. Those efforts crystallized into a plan from Kimpton Hotels to reactivate the historic property, only to see plans fizzle after the hotel chain sought more than $30-million in development incentives.\n",
      "The revised plan, which comes from HRI Hospitality Investments, calls for both the adaptive reuse of the 41,500 square-foot YWCA building, as well as the new construction of a five-story building on what is now a parking lot next door. Combined, the two buildings will contain a total of 217 hotel rooms - the bulk of which would be located in the new construction.\n",
      "The design team for the project includes ESa and Olin. Plans call for retaining and restoring the Morgan-designed building, which is of the Spanish Colonial Revival, while expanding the property with a new building described as a \"contemporary interpretation\" of its historic neighbor.  The new construction would maintain the existing central courtyard of the YWCA building, while also providing new open space at the roof level.\n",
      "The presentation to the Design Commission is for a preliminary review, in which commissioners will provide feedback and critiques on the design concept - including issues identified in a staff report.\n",
      "New plans for the YWCA building spawned from a 2019 request for proposals issued by the City of Pasadena seeking development options for two properties in its Civic Center. Among those is another property adjacent to City Hall at 280 Ramona Street, where National CORE is planning a five-story, 100-unit senior affordable housing complex.\n",
      "Several other properties in close proximity to the Civic Center, including a parking lot across the street from the hotel site, are also up for redevelopment with housing and commercial uses.\n",

      "Article Title: Plans for affordable housing move forward at 1318 4th Street in Santa Monica\n",
      "Article Subtitle: The project from EAH Housing would rise on the former site of Parking Structure 3\n",
      "Article Body: Two years after an unsuccessful campaign to block the demolition of Downtown Santa Monica's Parking Structure 3, plans to build affordable housing on the empty lot it left behind are starting to move forward.\n",
      "Last week, the Santa Monica City Council approved a design concept for the site at 1318 4th Street, which would permit the construction of at least 120 units of affordable and permanent supportive housing.\n",
      "EAH Housing, which has been selected to develop the publicly-owned property, is considering two alternatives for the site, including a six-story building featuring 122 studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments - with 50 units of supportive housing - atop ground-floor commercial space and subterranean parking for 116 vehicles. The second option would consist of a larger eight-story building containing up to 196 dwelling units atop ground-floor retail space and underground parking for 179 vehicles.\n",
      "Both alternatives would include ground-floor space designed to accommodate a grocery store and supportive services provided by The People Concern. VTBS Architects, Epstein & Associates, AMJ Construction Management, California Housing Partnership, and The Lynch Group, Inc. fill out the project team for each option.\n",
      "According to a staff presentation, the estimated cost of the smaller 122-unit alternative is $123 million, versus a $207.9-million price tag for the larger 196-unit alternative. In either case, the per-unit cost for the project would exceed $1 million, likely making the 1318 4th Street development the most expensive affordable housing development in Los Angeles County to date by that measure. Previously, projects that have crossed that threshold have been concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n",
      "While the council action does not preclude the possibility of potentially pursuing a larger project, staff and EAH are moving forward with the lower-scale alternative due to concerns about the ability to successfully finance the larger project. EAH hopes to begin applying for funding in March 2026 for the project, with the aim of commencing work in early 2028. That would pave the way for construction to be completed by 2030.\n",

      "Article Title: EAH Housing selected to redevelop Downtown Santa Monica parking garage\n",
      "Article Subtitle: But neighboring business owners are objecting\n",
      "Article Body: Even as neighboring business owners attempt to block the project, the City of Santa Monica is moving forward with plans to raze a public parking garage in near the Third Street Promenade to property with affordable housing.\n",
      "At a meeting earlier this month, the Santa Monica City Council approved an exclusive negotiation agreement with developer EAH housing for the site of Parking Structure 3 at 1318-1320 4th Street.\n",
      "“Our region suffers from a dearth of affordable housing and we in Santa Monica are committed to improving the crisis and getting people into housing that can be the foundation for stability,” said Santa Monica Mayor Sue Himmelrich in a statement. “We aren’t waiting for private development to lead the way. We are leading by making available a precious resource that makes it possible – land. This is a project that addresses the biggest needs of the day, including homelessness, affordability, and equity, and reflects our community’s values.” \n",
      "EAH, which was one of seven respondents to a request for proposals, has put forth two alternatives for the parking garage site, both of which come from a team that includes The People Concern, VTBS Architects, Epstein & Associates, AMJ Construction Management, California Housing Partnership, and The Lynch Group, Inc. Alternative schemes would either see 150 or 120 income-restricted units built on the site, with 50 units reserved as permanent supportive housing under both scenarios.\n",
      "In endorsing the selection of EAH, a staff report points to the firm's experience with large affordable and permanent supportive housing developments, two projects already approved or under construction in the City of Santa Monica.\n",
      "Final approval of the development agreement for the Parking Structure 3 site is contingent on approval by the Santa Monica City Council.\n",
